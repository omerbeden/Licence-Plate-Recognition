Licence Plate Recognition Using Tensorflow Object Detection API
![application](/app.png)
## Introduction
In this repository , I used Tensorflow Object Detection API on both train and inference time.It is very common API that could use.There is a few things you should do if you want to get this application as same as mine.

## Installition
### Tensorflow API Installiton
There is 2 option to install Tensorflow API. You can follow [original repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md) or you can follow [this repo](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10) to learn how to **train** a model and how to make **prediction** out of trained model.

### Extra Libraries
+ PyQt5
